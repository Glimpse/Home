Glimpse is an experimental **[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glimpse/glimpse)** that gives you in-depth insights about the **client and server sides** of your **Node.js** apps. More **efficient debugging** means **faster development**. Best of all, itâ€™s free.

## Getting started

  1.  In your app's root directory, use npm to install Glimpse.
  ```bash
  npm install @glimpse/glimpse --save-dev
  ```
  2. Initialize Glimpse before any other `require()` or application logic (typically at the top of index.js or app.js).
  ```javascript
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    require('@glimpse/glimpse').init();
  }
  ```
  3. Open your app in a browser. The Glimpse HUD should now be at the bottom right of your app.
